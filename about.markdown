I'm Matt McClellan, a high school English teacher in the Bay Area since 2016. I spent my first year teaching at Alpha: Cindy Avitia, a small charter on San Jose's east side, and have been teaching at Mountain View High School since then.

Before my teaching career, I spent my whole life (except a one-year sojourn to Santa Barbara) in the Boston area. In a past life I worked in admin at Harvard and lived in glamorous Somerville, MA.
