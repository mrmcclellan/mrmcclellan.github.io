### Digital history / data viz
As a grad student I created a project applying various digital humanities tools and approaches to do a "distant reading" of slave narratives in UNC's "Documenting the American South" online library.

### Harvard Kennedy School
Before my teaching career, I worked at the Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation as a research assistant and writer for the Project on Municipal Innovation.

### Harvard Gazette
When I worked for Harvard's office of Public Affairs & Communications, I had the opportunity to write a few stories for the Harvard Gazette, mostly on the arts and culture beat.
